# Boston-Eats
This is my portfolio project as a part of Codecademy CS career path course. I created a Boston based restaurant recommendation software that will output lists of restaurants around Boston area based on user input. User have the option to search for restaurants using up to 2 of the available 3 search criteria; keyword(category,food, or cuisine), price($,$$,or $$$), or closest MBTA station. User are also given an option to sort and display the results by name,price,and ratings.

The program by default imports data from a given tsv file consists of restaurants and their related infos. Bigger restaurant data set can be add by editing the tsv files or editing the code with different file name in restaurant_from_CSV functions as long as the file follows the same table format.

## Sample Data
Data were collected from google search of restaurants around Boston area with related info such as; cuisine type, food served, location, price, ratings, and closesnt MBTA station. For purpose of demonstration, the table contains at least 5 restaurants from at least 5 different locations with various cuisines.

## Running the program
Download all the files and run "python3 boseats.py" on terminal of choice. Follow the program instruction on the terminal.
